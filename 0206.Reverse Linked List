206.Reverse Linked List:

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

SOURCE CODE:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        prev = None
        current = head

        while current:
            next_node = current.next  # Save next
            current.next = prev       # Reverse the link
            prev = current            # Move prev forward
            current = next_node       # Move current forward

        return prev

OUTPUTS:

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
