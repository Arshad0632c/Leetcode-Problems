Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

SOURCE CODE:

from collections import Counter

class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        freq = Counter(s)          # 1) count every character once
        for i, ch in enumerate(s): # 2) scan characters in original order
            if freq[ch] == 1:      # 3) the first with frequency 1 is the answer
                return i
        return -1
 

OUTPUTS:

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1
